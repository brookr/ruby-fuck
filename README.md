# Brainf*ck
This is my initial attempt to implement a basic brainf*ck interpreter in Ruby. Any help DRY'ing it up or improving the algorithm to make it faster would be much appreciated! I know there are probably dozens of BF interpreters in Ruby on GitHub, but I wanted to reason through and write this by myself, so I'm holding back from looking at one.
